# FML-Mukbang
To be absolutely honest, this project is made to help me and my friends to pick a place to eat after the brilliant class (Fundamentals of Machine Learning). We are so bad at not making the decision to go to this one restaurant (still good) we are so sick of going. So we made a pack, the random draw from this algorithm can not be violated.
